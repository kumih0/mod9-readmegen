  # Title: ReadMe Generator CLI App

  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

  ## Description
  
  This is a ReadMe generator that will create a markdown file with user input from the command line.  There is added functionality and validation that only takes the input, prompts, and generate sections of the Readme based on the user's selection in the intial 'table of contents' selection.  If the user de-selects all, the default will include all sections and prompts.

 ## Installation 
 
 To run this bad boy, first install node dependencies by running 'npm i', then run the command 'node index.js'. 

 ## Usage 
 
 Feel free to use it if you want, it could use further modularization but you only need node.js to run it so that's pretty neato.
